A Rimworld mod that will display what the colonists are saying to each other, using a locally installed LLM. You will need Ollama running llama3.2:3b for this to work.

This is only tested on a Mac. To install:
```
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld/RimWorldMac.
app/Mods
$ git clone git@github.com:gavinblair/SocialInteractions.git
$ ollama run llama3.2:3b # if you don't already have it running
```
